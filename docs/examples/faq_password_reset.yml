    ## How do I reset my password?

    Click the "Forgot Password" link on the login page. Enter your email address
    and click "Send Reset Link". You'll receive an email with a password reset
    link within 5 minutes. Click the link and enter your new password. The link
    expires after 1 hour for security reasons.

    ## What if I don't receive the reset email?

    First, check your spam or junk folder. If you still don't see it, wait 10
    minutes before requesting another reset link (there's a rate limit). If you're
    still having issues, contact support at support@example.com with your registered
    email address.

    ## How secure is my password?

    We require passwords to be at least 8 characters long with a mix of uppercase
    and lowercase letters, numbers, and symbols. Passwords are hashed using
    industry-standard bcrypt algorithm before storage. We never store passwords
    in plain text and cannot recover your original password.

    ## Can I use the same password after resetting?

    Yes, but we don't recommend it. If you're resetting your password due to a
    security concern, you should choose a new, unique password that you haven't
    used before on any other service.
