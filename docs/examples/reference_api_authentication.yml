    ## Authentication Methods

    The API supports Bearer token authentication. All authenticated endpoints
    require a valid API key in the Authorization header.

    ## Bearer Token Authentication

    Include your API key in the Authorization header with every request:

    ```
    Authorization: Bearer your-api-key-here
    ```

    Example curl command:
    ```bash
    curl -H "Authorization: Bearer sk-abc123xyz" \
         https://api.example.com/v1/chat/conversations
    ```

    ## Getting an API Key

    API keys are generated from the dashboard:

    1. Log in to your account
    2. Navigate to Settings > API Keys
    3. Click "Generate New Key"
    4. Copy the key immediately (it won't be shown again)
    5. Store it securely (treat it like a password)

    ## Key Management Best Practices

    - Never commit API keys to version control
    - Use environment variables for key storage
    - Rotate keys regularly (every 90 days recommended)
    - Use different keys for development and production
    - Revoke compromised keys immediately

    ## Error Responses

    Invalid or missing authentication returns HTTP 401:

    ```json
    {
      "error": "Unauthorized",
      "message": "Invalid or missing API key"
    }
    ```

    Expired or revoked keys return HTTP 403:

    ```json
    {
      "error": "Forbidden",
      "message": "API key has been revoked"
    }
    ```
