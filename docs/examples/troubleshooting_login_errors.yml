    ## "Invalid Credentials" Error

    This error means the email/password combination doesn't match our records.

    **Solutions:**
    - Double-check your email address for typos
    - Ensure Caps Lock is off when entering your password
    - Try the "Forgot Password" flow to reset your password
    - If you recently changed your password, make sure you're using the new one

    ## "Account Locked" Error

    Your account is temporarily locked after 5 failed login attempts within 15 minutes.

    **Solutions:**
    - Wait 15 minutes and try again
    - Use the "Forgot Password" link to reset your password (this unlocks your account)
    - Contact support if you believe your account was compromised

    ## "Email Not Verified" Error

    You must verify your email before logging in.

    **Solutions:**
    - Check your inbox for the verification email (including spam folder)
    - Click the "Resend Verification Email" link on the login page
    - If the verification link expired, request a new one
    - Contact support if you can't access the email address

    ## Session Expired Error

    Your login session has expired for security reasons (after 24 hours of inactivity).

    **Solutions:**
    - Simply log in again with your credentials
    - Enable "Remember Me" to extend session duration to 30 days
    - Close and reopen your browser if the error persists

    ## Two-Factor Authentication Issues

    Problems with 2FA codes not working.

    **Solutions:**
    - Ensure your device clock is synchronized (2FA codes are time-based)
    - Try the next code if the current one expired
    - Use backup codes if you lost access to your 2FA device
    - Contact support to disable 2FA if you've lost all access methods
